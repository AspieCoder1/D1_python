# A Level Further Mathematics Decision 1 Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a python implementation of most of the algorithms that are taught in the A-Level further maths D1 module.

## Chapter One

* Bubble sort (`bubble.py`)
* Quick sort (`quicksort.py`)
* First fit decreasing bin packing algorithm (`binpacking.py`)

## Chapter Two

* Kruskals Algorithm (`kruskals.py`)
* Primm's Algorithm (`primms.py`)
